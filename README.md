# Garage System 🚗

A sophisticated garage management system built on the ATmega32 microcontroller. This system provides two modes of operation: User and Admin, facilitating both the parking process for users and administrative management for garage owners.

## Features 🌟
- **Automated Gate Control**: Servo motor integration to automate the gate opening/closing process.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Keypad and LCD provide an interactive experience for users.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Integration with EEPROM ensures data retention even in the event of power loss.
- **Dual Mode Operation**: 
  - **User Mode**: Allows users to input their unique car ID, initiate parking duration, and calculate parking time for billing upon departure.
  - **Admin Mode (password protected)**: Enables manual gate control, monitoring of current cars in the garage, and access to historical parking data.

## System Components 🛠
1. **Servo Motor**: Automates the garage gate movement.
2. **Keypad**: Lets users and admins interact with the system.
3. **LCD**: Visual display for system interaction and feedback.
4. **EEPROM**: Non-volatile storage for car IDs, parking duration, and more.

## Implementation 🖥
Built using the ATmega32 microcontroller and prototyped with Proteus Simulation.
